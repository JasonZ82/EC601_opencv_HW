The Exercise2 is about Color.

The python code is in ColorImage.py and others are the results.

The value of the pixel at(20,25) for RGB is 106,122,255.

For YCbCr is 151,181,103

For HSV is 4,135,225

For RGB, the range for each color is:0-255

For YCbCr, the Y is Luminance, Cb and Cr are chroma components for blue and red. There are two sitation for range in YCbCr.

For Sub sampling ratio of 4:2:0

Y: 16 - 235

Cb: 16 - 240

Cr: 16 - 240

For Sub sampling ratio of 4:4:4

Y: 0 - 255

Cb: 0 - 255

Cr: 0 - 255

For HSV,H:0-180, S&V:0-255
