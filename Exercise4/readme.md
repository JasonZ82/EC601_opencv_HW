The exercise4 is about threshold.

As can be seen from the result, the binary threshold divide the picture into white and black. The colors are divided equally. 

For the semi threshold, it seems to be the opposite of the picture. 

As for the band threshold, it taks the upper band and the lower band, which maks the picture strange.

Last but not the least, the adaptive threshold makes the most comfort picture.

The disadvantage of the binary threshold, it will divide the color strickly, which can make it hard to tell the brightness in the picture.
Cut in half is not always good in picture, some important information might be lost.

As the for advantage of the adaptive threshold, it can be added to multiple thresholds, so for the picture that have different lighting conditions, the adaptive threshold can be of great use.
